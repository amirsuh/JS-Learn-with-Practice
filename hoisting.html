    Hoisting is a default behavior of js in which all the function declaration and variables moved to the top iof their scope (global or function scope) before the code is executed and variables with var assigned a default value in memory execution phase and functions were move as its so we can access functions without before they are written in the code functions and var support hoisting let and const were support but it remains in TDZ they can access only after initialization

    Hoisting moves declarations to the top of their scope.

Variables declared with var are hoisted with a default value (undefined).

Function declarations are fully hoisted, so they can be called before their definition.

let and const are hoisted but stay in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) until initialized.

A closure is a function that remembers variables from its lexical scope, even after the outer function has finished executing.

Lexical scope means the scope of a variable is determined by its position in the code.

An inner function can access variables from its outer function and even global scope.

Closures are what allow functions to “carry” their environment with them.

          <p>Hoisting is a default behavior of JS where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before code execution. Variables with <code>var</code> are initialized as <code>undefined</code>. Functions can be called before they are written. <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are hoisted but in TDZ until initialized.</p>
